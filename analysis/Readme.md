## Analysis folder
In this folder we will structure the editorial and analytical part of the website.

The proposal is to have python notebooks that can analyze live data.

Every notebook should produce one Chart, and the chart will then be mapped and
blended with the rest of the UI of the website.

Upon change of the underlying data, or of a notebook, or of the UI, the whole
website is rebuilt and redeployed
